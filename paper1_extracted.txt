generate complex parasitic structures without being too

C. Problem Formulation
Following the concept of GAD, approaching the
performance limit of the ESA based on the proposed 3-D
configuration can be formulated as a multiobjective
optimization problem. The two conflict objectives are electrical
size ka and fractional bandwidth BW. The optimization
problem to be solved can be described as follows:

performance when tackling large-scale mixed-variable
multiobjective problems with high computational cost. In
particular, the Chu limit is transformed into an explicit Pareto
front to guide the optimization process. The performance-limit-
guided MOP decomposition and the reference-point solution
assignment are employed to direct the algorithm toward the
performance limit. Other prior knowledge is also integrated
into offspring reproduction and population initialization to
further improve algorithm efficiency and effectiveness.
A. Performance-Limit-Guided MOP Decomposition
In decomposition-based multi-objective optimization
frameworks, an MOP is decomposed into a set of scalarizing
single-objective subproblems, each generated by a scalarizing
function with a different weight vector. However, existing
studies have shown that the performance of MOEA/D is
strongly influenced by the shape and distribution of the
underlying Pareto front [38],[39]. This indicates that tailoring
the decomposition strategy to the characteristics of the
problem’s Pareto front can significantly improve algorithmic
performance.
In this work, we leverage physical performance limit theory
(Chu limit) and relevant engineering constraints to explicitly
construct the feasible region and the corresponding true Pareto
front in the objective space. These physically grounded
Pareto-optimal boundaries are uniformly sampled to generate
reference points for subproblem scalarization, enabling the
MOEA/D to align more closely with the design problem’s
intrinsic structure and thereby achieve enhanced convergence
and diversity. (1)

types. (3) Variable-length design space: the dimension of the
continuous parameters varies from 4 to 108, defined by the
binary parameters. (4) Expensive optimization: each EM
full-wave simulation takes about 3 mins. This problem is
typically a generative antenna design problem, and prior
knowledge is indeed an efficient and effective optimization.

To ensure one-to-one assignment, the selected reference points
z ( j) is removed from the candidate set z once matched. As
shown in Fig.4, each dot corresponds to a solution because its
location is closest to the corresponding reference line.
The pseudocode of population reassignment is presented in
Subalgorithm 1. For each subproblem g (k ) , neighborhood B(k)
is predefined based on the sequence of reference points. As
shown in Fig.4, the red dot represents the solution assigned to
the subproblem g (k ) , while the green dots are assigned to
neighboring subproblems. These solutions form the mating
pool for offspring reproduction of g(k).
C. Mixed Variable Coding and Offspring Reproduction
In the proposed algorithm framework, each individual x
encodes a candidate ESA structure, and can be represented by
an ( M + M  k ) -dimensional mixed-variable vector:
x = [ x b1 , , x bM , x c1,1 , , x c1,k , , x cM

( x bi = 1 ) or absent ( x bi = 0 ) , and each group
{ x c }
i,j
kj=1 = [ x ci,1 , , x ci,k ] specifies the geometry and orientation
of that rod
Reproduction follows a two-part strategy. The pseudocode is
represented in Subalgorithm 2. Binary mutation is applied first,
using the DE/rand/1 strategy, to generate a mutated binary
vector vb. In parallel, the continuous vector xc is first mutated
using DE/rand/1, followed by polynomial mutation to obtain vc.
The parent vectors are selected from the neighborhood defined
by the population reassignment. A uniform crossover is then
performed on the binary variables xb and vb to generate the
offspring ub. The associate continuous group { x c }

; otherwise, from vc. After
boundary repair, the offspring is evaluated using a coarse mesh
EM model. The process is repeated up to four times or until a
valid structure is found.
A key feature of this strategy is the coupling between
structural presence and parameter optimization. Each rod’s
geometry is optimized only when it is active, avoiding
unnecessary updates to non-existent structures. The approach
reflects a fundamental principle in antenna design: only
physical elements that appear in the design affect performance
and deserve tuning. At the same time, the parameter dimension
remains fixed, with optimization applied only to meaningful
structures.
D. Prior-Knowledge Guided Population Initialization
Prior knowledge from the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ESA
structures [41]-[44] can effectively guide the generation of
high-quality candidates during population initialization. Based
on this PK, the probability of generation can be intuitively Each xc is sampled from a piecewise constant distribution

E. Performance-Limit-Guided MOEA/D Framework
The pseudocode of performance-limit-guided MOEA/D
framework is presented in Algorithm 1. Initially, the reference
points are uniformly sampled from the derived true Pareto front.
Then, the MOP is decomposed into multiple scalarizing
subproblems corresponding to reference points (Step 1). Next,
a neighborhood set B is constructed for each reference point by
calculating the Euclidean distance among reference points
(Step 2-4). The initial population P(0) is generated using a
PK-guided strategy that samples mixed variables from
customized probability distributions derived from
representative ESA designs (Step 5). The main evolutionary
loop iterates until the maximum number of generations (t ) is max
reached.
Within each generation, three steps are executed:
1) Individuals are first sorted by performance and reassigned
to the most suitable subproblems using Population
Reassignment, enabling prioritized mating and better
parent selection.
2) For the subproblem corresponding to each individual,
parents are selected from either the neighborhood or the
entire population based on a predefined probability , and
offspring is generated using Offspring Reproduction.
3) Each offspring is evaluated against the entire population
using scalarizing functions, and up to two solutions are
replaced, enabling global update of high-quality solutions.
Eventually, the final population P is output.
Table II summarizes the PK and their functions in the
proposed framework. The positions of PK are also annotated in
the framework flowchart shown in Fig. 5. The proposed
PK-guided framework introduces two major innovations:
 PK 1 defines the decomposition of the MOP and the
construction of the true Pareto front, fundamentally
shaping the convergence behavior of the algorithm. With
this PK, the algorithm shifts from traditional weight-based
guidance to a strategy that focuses on rapidly generating
high-quality solutions and globally spreading them across

the population, thereby accelerating convergence toward
subproblem targets.
 PKs 2–5 jointly support the optimization stages across
population initialization, parent selection, mixed-variable
offspring generation, and fast feasibility screening. This
forms a cohesive mechanism that efficiently produces
physically meaningful and high-quality solutions.
In essence, the proposed framework modifies MOEA/D
using PK to rapid convergence in large scale design spaces.
IV. GENERATIVE ESA DESIGN USING OPTIMIZATION
In this section, we simplified the ESA configuration in
Section II-B with prior knowledge constraints for further
fabrication and optimized it for approaching performance limit
using the proposed algorithm.
A. Prior Knowledge Constraints
The configuration described in Section II-B provides
sufficient DoF to generate complex ESA structures. However,
to balance design and fabrication feasibility, certain structural
parameters that minimally affect EM performance can be
further simplified. Two PK constraints are introduced to reduce
the dimensionality of the design space, as illustrated in Fig. 6.
(1) Constraining metal rods to specific planes. As shown in Fig.
6 (b), the 27 metal rods are divided into three groups, with each
group constrained to a specific plane defined by an azimuthal
angle  (i.e., =0,30,60 in the xoy-plane). Only the
elevation angle  of each rod is adjustable. This
plane-constrained arrangement promotes physical connectivity
between rods, enabling the effective generation of resonant
structures and fabrication feasibility. (2) Adoption of square
metal bars with fixed side length. The original metal rods are
replaced by square metal bars with a fixed side length, as
depicted in Fig. 6(c). This modification minimally affects EM
performance but enhances fabrication feasibility.
As demonstrated in Fig. 6, with these PK constraints, the
number of parameters is reduced from 135 to 81. The design
parameters include 27 binary variables to determine the
presence of the metal square bar at the predefined position and
54 continuous variables to control each bar’s length and
rotation angle. This parameter reduction significantly
simplifies the optimization problem while preserving sufficient
DoF for performance optimization.
B. Optimization Results
The proposed algorithm is initialized with a population size
of 162 individuals and 20 total generations. The 3-D ESA
configuration, as shown in Fig. 6, is optimized. Fig. 7 shows the
final Pareto front and the population of the 20th generation.
Nine solutions in the final Pareto front exceed the fractional
bandwidth limit (upper-left boundary) derived from Chu limit
[20]. It is evident that these nine individuals distributed along
the derived Pareto front demonstrate that the derived PF based
on the Chu-limit theory effectively guides the population
toward convergence.
Four solutions are selected and illustrated in Fig. 8. The

C. Performance Comparison with Baseline Algorithms 0.15
The classical NSGA-II and MOEA/D are introduced for 0.1
performance comparison. To examine the influence of the prior
knowledge, all algorithms are applied to the PK-constrained 0.05
ESA generative design problem defined in Section II and IV-A.

To evaluate the performance of the algorithms, the signed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 111213141516 17181920
inverted generation distance (IGD) metric is utilized. The
proposed Chu-limit-guided MOEA/D integrates PK 1–5 in
addition to the PK constraint, whereas NSGA-II and MOEA/D
are executed only with the PK constraint. For statistical
comparison, each algorithm is independently executed five
times. The performance limit derived from Section III-A is
employed as the Pareto front. The population size of all
algorithms is set to 2  d (i.e. 162), where d is the dimension.
The mixed-variable encoding method in NSGA II and
MOEA/D is the real-coded strategy. The uniform selection,
intermediate crossover, and feasible mutation are utilized in
NSGA II by default. The weighted-sum decomposition is
utilized in MOEA/D. The population size and neighborhood
size are set to be 162 and 20. All algorithms terminate after 20
generations due to the limited simulation budget.
Fig. 9 shows the statistical convergence curves of MOEA/D,
NSGA II, and the proposed method over 20 generations. The
MOEA/D and NSGA II show a limited reduction in signed IGD
within the limited simulation budget, with mean signed IGD
values above 0.15. In contrast, the proposed framework
exhibits a consistent decrease in signed IGD, reaching values
lower than 0.05. This observation is also confirmed in Table III.
The proposed method achieves the smallest final signed IGD
value of 0.0458 ± 0.0138 among the three algorithms.
Meanwhile, the proposed method requires 3718 ± 121
simulations (~37 hours), compared with 3240 simulations (~34
hours) for MOEA/D and NSGA II.
The difference in convergence behavior also appears in the
number of beyond-limit solutions obtained. As a result of better
final population of NSGA II and MOEA/D. In contrast, the

techniques, as shown in Fig. 12. The printing material based on
copper is utilized for ensuring high electrical conductivity,
which is Copper-Chromium-Zirconium alloy (CuCrZr,
Conductivity ≥ 85% IACS). The 50 Ω discrete port in the
original structure can be equivalent to 25 Ω coaxial port in the
monopole-like structure. The impedance transformer connected
to SMA port and 25 Ω coaxial port is designed with PCB
fabrication technique, as shown in Fig. 13.
B. Impedance bandwidth and radiation pattern
The antenna prototype of the fabricated solution is shown in
Fig. 14. Fig.15 shows that the measured and simulated
impedance bandwidth for |S | < -10 dB is 54.3% (2.08-3.63
11
GHz) and 50.3% (2.05-3.43 GHz), respectively. The measured
and simulated realized gain over the operating band varies
between 1.72-3.86 dBi and 2.14-3.3 dBi, respectively. The
simulated directivity over the operating band varies between
3.01-5.1 dBi. The simulated total efficiency is approximately
80%. The good agreement between measured and simulated
results shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The
bandwidth-efficiency product Bη is 0.402, while the
corresponding performance limit Bη is 0.389.
Table IV summarizes the performance characteristics of the
fabricated solution and representative wideband antennas. The
calculation of ka does not include the physical size of feeding
baluns or large ground planes. For designs [22], [45]-[49] at
ka=0.91-1.07, the reported designs achieve bandwidths
14%-17.3%. The reported design in [50] and [51] realized
67.7% and 55.6% bandwidth at electrically larger sizes of
ka=1.4 and 1.73, respectively. The fabricated solution achieves
broad bandwidth (50.3%) with high radiation efficiency (80%)
at an electrically small size (ka=1.05). Meanwhile, the
proposed design maintains stable radiation patterns (2.7-3.9
dBi) over its wide operating band. In terms of fabrication
complexity, the compared prototypes utilize multilayer
substrates [49], NFRP or parasitic loading [45],[46],[48],[51],
complex feeding structures [47], or 3D-printed dielectric shells
[22],[52]. In contrast, the fabricated solution is realized as
metal structure with a simple feeding structure, achieving the
highest performance ratio (R=1.03) among the designs. Fig. 16 presents the bandwidth-efficiency product Bƞ from
Table III against their ka values. The performance limit derived
from (2), based on the Chu-sphere, is included for comparison.
