Explain what is c what pi what is f what is c 
When ka < 0.5 means the antenna is electrical small this should be a critical point. So this should be much bigger.
For the two antenna size compare use two image to showcase 

WHY? section explain not enough "Small antennas store energy in near-field before radiating:"
why can antenna store energy? why only in near-field? what do you mean before radiating. 
why High stored energy = high Quality Factor (Q)
why High Q = sharp resonance = narrow bandwidth
why Relationship:  (for narrowband)

You need to explain more 

Page 5 :

Equation is too small. why Q measure energy vs storage radiation?
what is BW??
what is chu limit ? you didn't explain ????
what do you my research ????? the wording needs double check.
